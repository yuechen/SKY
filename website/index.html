	<h2>The Idea</h2>

	<p>One Tuesday evening, Sam, Karl, and Yuechen sat within the hallowed halls of Harvard, pondering the next big problem that they want to solve using data. Sam exclaimed, "Guys, wouldn't it be awesome if we could predict stock movement? We'd be billionaires overnight!"</p>

	<p>Indeed, that would be cool. But exactly how might we do that?<p>

	<p>"We could analyze Google Trend data," Sam said, "Maybe the popularity of certain search terms on Google would give us a clue about how stock price for a certain company is going move."</p>

	<p>"So, you mean, if over a week, people searched the word Apple a lot, that could indicate that Apple's stock is going to rise?" Yuechen asked, skeptical.</p>

	<p>The idea was crazy. But these kids were pretty crazy too. Besides, it doesn't hurt to try, right?</p>
