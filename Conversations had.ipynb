      "**Overview and Motivation:**\n",
      "The goal of our project is, very simply, to come up with a way of predicting stock market movements.  The motivation for this is that if we can predict stock market movements, then we can make money off of this and... well, frankly, I'm somewhat unconvinced that having money will lead to anything that is of real value... but it's a fun exercise.  The way that we have chosen to attempt to predict these movements is by a combination of google search trend data and previous stock prices.  We are going to try and predict stock price movements based on google search trend data on words related to the company (e.g. \"apple,\" \"iPhone,\" and \"OSX\" for the company Apple)"
