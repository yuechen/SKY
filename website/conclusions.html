	<h2>Conclusions</h2>

	<p>SKY's models did not depend at all on fundamental underpinnings of the individual companies, but rather they are based on studying weekly stock price and Google Trends without regard for the characteristics of the underlying company being studied. This makes it very generalizable and allows SKY to easily analyze lots of different companies.</p>

	<p>Predicting stock movement is difficult, and this project does not prove that SKY has found a decisive way to game the system. However, it has shown that these methods show promise and that further investigation may very well result in better models that provide better returns.</p>

	<p>Without a tool for actually drawing in current data about stocks, the model remains inactionable. That is, SKY cannot yet provide investors with daily or weekly lists of stocks that they should invest in. Stay tuned for the development of a platform that will capitalize on these findings!</p>
