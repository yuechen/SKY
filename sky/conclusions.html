	<h2>Conclusions</h2>

	<p>SKY's models so far have not depended at all on the fundamental underpinnings of the individual companies, that is, they are based on studying weekly stock prices and Google Trends without regard for the characteristics of the underlying company. This makes it very generalizable and allows SKY to easily analyze numerous different companies.</p>

	<p>Predicting stock movement is difficult, and this project does not prove that SKY has found a decisive way to game the system. However, it has shown that these methods show promise and that further investigation may very well result in better models that provide even better returns.</p>

	<p>But SKY will not quit. They have numerous ideas for further exploration and development of these models. Once they have tweaked the models to their satisfaction, you better make sure you bring your umbrella along! (jk!)</p>
